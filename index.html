		<p><h2>About Me</h2></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 30%; margin-top: 0px;font-size:20px">
		My name is Michael Shields and I'm a junior currently enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh
		studying Computer Science and minoring in Information Science. I've always had a huge interest in both these
		fields, specifically in the creation of software itself and artificial intelligence. To acquire a career involving
		any of these two would be a dream for me.
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 30%; margin-top: 0px;font-size:20px">
		As a full time student, I try to keep my studies in check, but when I'm not studying, I enjoy
		hanging with friends, playing all sorts of video games, and watching TV. Additionally, I'm a big fan
		of all things soccer.
